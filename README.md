# name project


## Username is created based on the algorithm of the full fist name and 2 letters of lastname
ex bahram alzuhairi = bahram.al


## if the user has other names like a middle name or something like that the program is gonna either forget about
the other names and continue using only the full name and 2 letters of lastname or shorten the extra names to 1 letter
of each as a lastname.

ex bahram assad atiyah alzuhairi = bahram.aaa

## push

after every editing I make I'll have to commit and push it up.
