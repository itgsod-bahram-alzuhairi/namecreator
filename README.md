# name project

## Username creation
Username is created based on the algorithm of the full fist name and 2 letters of lastname

ex bahram alzuhairi = bahram.al


## Extra names such as middlenames
If the user has other names like a middlename the program is gonna shorten the extra names to 1 letter
of each as a lastname 

ex bahram assad atiyah alzuhairi = bahram.aaa 

But if the username has only one middlename the program is supposed to take the 2 first letter from the middlename and
lastname and make it into the lastname

ex bahram asaad alzuhairi = bahram.asal

## Push
